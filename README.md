# Kongpon C. dotfiles

This repository contains configurations, applications and tools when migrating
to a new macOS environment. All the setups are based on
[Kongpon's](https://github.com/kykungz) preferences, and might not be most
people's favorite. Think carefully before running the scripts.

## ⚠️ Warning

**DO NOT** run the setup snippet if you don't fully understand what it does. It
might cause your programs to malfunction due to the configuration files that
will be replaced throughout the installation.

## ⏬ Installation

1. Open _Terminal_ (in your Applications)
2. Paste the following script and hit Enter

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -LsS https://raw.github.com/kykungz/dotfiles/master/install-remote.sh)"
```

_Please do not modify the script, otherwise the setup will not perform
expectedly._
